# Password-Generator
Generates a password with predefined conditions and allows user input to change said conditions.

To use this class, call it after including the header file. The constructor handles all input and output so all you need to is call the constructor. It also has a function to output the generated password as a string if you want to modify or use it later.
A main.cpp is included to show how to use the class as well.
